## About Me and Stuffs

Hai I'm creare and I really like making games, I started like 9 years ago on khan academy! I have the terrible curse of never quite finishing most of my projects...
I've made [Evolve 3D](projects/evolve-3d) which averages 200 concurrent players and has been played about 6 million times :D
